Dataset for: Potential new bio-fortified potato varieties high in iron and zinc to contribute to food and nutrition security in Junin, Peru.

A select group of 30 tetraploid biofortified clones from cycle I will be evaluated using a farmer participatory variety selection (PVS) in the highland of Cajamarca during the campaign 2018-2019; yield components, micronutrients content (Fe & Zn) and post-harvest traits will be determinated, with the main purpose to improve the food security and nutrition of families in situation of vulnerability through the identification of 3-5 potential new biofortified potatoes varieties with 25% of micronutrient concentration (Fe) above the local varieties. Fe and Zn determinations were conducted in CIP-La Molina, Lima, using the X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (XRF) method.
