# units for grain yield not specified if it is kg/ha,

  Grain yield data collected from Conservation Agriculture (CA) systems across experiments of varying
  experimental duration, established in trial locations of Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe under 
  an increasingly variable climate. Data contains different agro-environmental yield response moderators such 
  as type of crop diversifcation and amount of rainfall and aims to identify cropping systems that may provide 
  both short-term gains and longer-term sustainability.
