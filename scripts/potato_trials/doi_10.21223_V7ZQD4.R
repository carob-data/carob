	Description:
	
	During the period 2020-2021, experiments were planted to study the phenotypic stability of tuber yield in thirty advanced clones of the B3C3 population, using the Row-Column statistical design with three replications of ten plants in each experiment. Amarilis, Canchan, and Chucmarina varieties were used as controls, the fertilization dose was 200-180-160 kg NPK per hectare, and pest control was carried out as in a normal potato crop; 
	no fungicides were used for late blight control because the clones are resistant to the disease.The experiment was conducted in the Lastly-Huancayo locality. Harvesting took place 120 days after planting.
