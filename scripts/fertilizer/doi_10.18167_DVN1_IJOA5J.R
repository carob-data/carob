  This dataset comprises data from on farm trials conducted in sub-humid Zimbabwe during two 
  cropping seasons (2017/18-2018/19). The study investigated the effect of maize-cowpea
  intercropping on productivity, biological N2-fixation and grain mineral content compared 
  to sole crops. The effect of soil characteristics (homefield vs outfield) and of cowpea 
  varieties landrace) was also studied (2020-08-17)
